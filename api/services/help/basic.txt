O HAI I'm helping you. If you ever need help, just run the /help command. This will
invoke private help messages that only you will see.

Bunker has some commands that you can run from the chat message box.
Type a slash and then the command name, like this:

	/&lt;command&gt;

COMMANDS:
	help		shows this message
	away		set away status
	magic8ball	shake the magic 8-ball
	me			make your avatar do something
	nick		change your nickname
	roll		roll a die
	topic		change the topic of the room
	hangman     play a game of hangman

TOPICS:
	formatting	how to format message text (italic, bold, etc)
	gravatar	how to change your gravatar
	images		how to upload an image to the room

To get help on a specific command or topic type '/help [command|topic]'.  Examples:

	/help nick
	/help images
	/help hangman
