TEXT FORMATTING

You can format the text of room messages by wrapping text in special characters:

italics       - enclose text with "_" to make the text italic
bold          - enclose text with "*" to make the text bold
spoilers      - enclose text with "|" to hide it from others
strikethrough - enclose text with "~" to make the text strikethrough

Example:

&#95;Every day&#95; my &#42;cat&#42; eats &#126;tomahawks&#126; fish.
&#124;The cat eats the tomahawks anyway&#124;

This will be displayed as:

_Every day_ my *cat* eats ~tomahawks~ fish.
|The cat eats the tomahawks anyway|
